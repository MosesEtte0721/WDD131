            <p>
                I’m a dedicated web developer with hands-on experience in PHP and back-end web development, 
                gained through my internship at Skep Foundation. There, I crafted innovative solutions for various projects, 
                sharpening my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. As a Student Project Manager, 
                I led student initiatives, ensuring timely delivery and high-quality results through effective collaboration. 
                I am anticipating Bachelor’s degree in Applied Technology from Brigham Young University - Idaho, 
                complemented by certifications in Front-End Web Development, React.js Essential Training, Computer Programming,
                 and Web Development. These achievements have equipped me with a strong foundation in both technical and leadership skills. 
                 Passionate about technology’s potential to drive progress, I’m eager to apply my expertise in web development and project 
                 management to create impactful solutions that advance the tech industry and benefit society. My goal is to continue 
                 growing as a developer while contributing to innovative projects that make a difference.
